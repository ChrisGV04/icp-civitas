dfx build --check # Check that builds work correctly and prepare app
dfx deploy backend # Deploy backend to local replica
```

Finally, run the app in dev mode:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## ðŸš€ Deploy to mainnet

To deploy the canisters, run the following commands:

```bash
dfx generate # Generate app
dfx deploy --network ic # Deploy to IC network
# Or dfx deploy --playground to run in playground mode
```
